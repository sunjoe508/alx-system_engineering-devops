# Postmortem: The Great Web Application Meltdown of August 2024

## Issue Summary

- **Duration**: August 12, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 (UTC)
- **Impact**: Our beloved web application went on a coffee break for 2.5 hours, leaving 60% of users hanging. During this time, users couldn’t log in, view their dashboards, or even check if their favorite cat memes had been updated. *What a tragedy!*
- **Root Cause**: The outage was caused by a mischievous error in the load balancer configuration that sent traffic on a wild goose chase to non-responsive servers. *Load balancer, we need to talk about your career aspirations.*

## Timeline

- **14:00 UTC**: The issue was detected when users started complaining about downtime—turns out, people really don’t enjoy being denied access to their dashboards. *Who knew?*
- **14:05 UTC**: Monitoring alerts chimed in like an overzealous alarm clock, signaling increased error rates and server unresponsiveness. *The alarms were definitely working overtime.*
- **14:15 UTC**: Initial investigation revealed the load balancer was having an identity crisis and not distributing traffic properly. *It’s not easy being a load balancer.*
- **14:30 UTC**: We assumed the load balancer was at fault—turns out we were right, but it took a while to get there. *Better late than never, right?*
- **14:45 UTC**: Expanded investigation focused on recent changes to the load balancer configuration—spoiler alert: the recent update was the villain of this story. *Plot twist!*
- **15:00 UTC**: It became clear that a recent update had messed up the routing rules, turning our load balancer into a traffic jam creator. *No traffic jams, please!*
- **15:15 UTC**: The DevOps team was summoned for their superhero skills to tackle the issue. *Cue the superhero music.*
- **15:30 UTC**: The issue was resolved by rolling back the ill-fated configuration change—traffic was back on track. *Victory!*
- **16:00 UTC**: Service was restored, and user access was confirmed to be working again—time to celebrate with virtual high-fives. *High-fives all around!*
- **16:30 UTC**: A post-incident review meeting was held to discuss what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. *Let's learn from our escapades.*

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause**: The outage was due to a configuration blunder in the load balancer’s routing rules. It had been programmed to send traffic to servers that were either off duty or otherwise unavailable. *Classic mix-up.*
- **Resolution**: The immediate fix was to roll back the faulty configuration and reconfigure the load balancer to ensure proper traffic routing. Post-resolution, additional monitoring was set up to ensure stability. *Back on track and better than ever.*

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements**:
  - Upgrade our load balancer configuration management to ensure it's always in tip-top shape. *No more identity crises!*
  - Schedule more frequent configuration audits and automated tests to catch potential issues early. *Be proactive, not reactive.*

- **Tasks**:
  - **Patch**: Review and rigorously test all recent configuration changes before deployment. *No more surprises!*
  - **Update Documentation**: Keep detailed records of load balancer configuration rules and rollback procedures. *Documentation is your friend.*
  - **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement advanced monitoring and alerting for load balancer changes. *We want to hear the alarms before they scream.*
  - **Automate Testing**: Develop automated tests to simulate traffic routing changes before going live. *Better safe than sorry.*
  - **Training**: Train DevOps staff on load balancer management and troubleshooting. *Superhero training for everyone!*
